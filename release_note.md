# What's New:

- LDtk 1.5.1 Support.
- LDtk Tocs available.
- Chunk unloading. (Experimental)

# What's Fixed:

- Sprites of entities loaded from LDtk will flicker when they are overlapping with each other.
- `LdtkLevelManager` won't be aware of the failure when loading the level.
- Replaced some path combination with the `Path` from `std` instead of `format!()`
