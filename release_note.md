# What's New:

- Use `Color` for tile tint instead of `Vec4`.
- Added `PhysicsTileSpawn` event which allows you to control more about the physics tile when it's spawned.
- Added the forgotten `TilemapAabbs` to the tilemap bundle...
- Improved tilemap visibility control.
- Output the hint correctly when there're multiple tilesets on one tiled tilemap layer. #22 

# What's Fixed:

- Incorrect color display.
