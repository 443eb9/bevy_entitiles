# What's New:

- Optimization on pathfinding and wave function collapse. Both of them are fast now.
- Asynchronous pathfinding.
- Asynchronous wfc.
- Animated tiles.
- Physics tiles added. Support both `rapier` and `xpbd`. With `TileCollision` event, you can easily get the collided tile.

# What's Next:

- SSAO
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
