# Bevy EntiTiles üó∫Ô∏è

A 2d tilemap library for bevy. With many useful algorithms/tools built in.

This repo is under maintenance as long as this message exists. ( Hope this message can bring you peace of mind. Yeah, that's childish :p )

Notice that the following progress may **not up to date**. Check the `README.md` in `dev` branch to get the latest progress!

It's **NOT** recommended to use the code in `dev` branch! There's full of incomplete code and even errors! But `master` branch would be ok if you can't wait to try out new features. If you are curious about what will be updated next, you can check the `release_note` in `dev` branch.

## Currently Working On

- [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) Support (expect: before Christmas!!)

## Future Goals

- Wave Function Collapse ( Optimization; Collapse map patterns )
- ~~Pathfinding~~
- Tilemap-Link
- Runtime Mesh & Texture Baking
- Wang Tilling
- Tilemap Mask
- Frustum Culling ( Optimization )
- ~~Physics~~
- Chunk Unloading
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) Support
- SSAO
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
- Lighting
- Realtime Shadow

## Known Issues

*Versions in the end of the line means when the issue will be fixed. `m` means it has already fixed in master branch. Empty if it's not on schedule or the source is unclear.*

- The success probability of the wfc algorithm significantly decreased after switching to `LookupHeap`. ( And that's why I didn't switch to `LookupHeap` )
- The aabbs of tilemaps and chunks are not correct. ( But I remember I had fixed them. Weird. ) `0.2.3m`
- `TileFlip` are not working correctly. `0.2.3m`

## Features

| Flag             | Funtionality                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `algorithm`      | Implementation of algorithms                                                                                            |
| `debug`          | Show some debug info including aabbs for chunks and tilemaps, path finding results etc.                                 |
| `debug-verbose`  | Show verbose process of functions. This feature is only useful when debug algorithms. But it's useless for most of you. |
| `physics_rapier` | Physics support for [`bevy_rapier`](https://github.com/dimforge/bevy_rapier)                                            |
| `physics_xpbd`   | Physics support for [`bevy_xpbd`](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd), like setting colliders etc.                    |
| `serializing`    | Save and load the tilemap from files. Also contains tools for upgrading files.                                          |
| `ui`             | Support renderring tiles as ui image.                                                                                   |

## Performance

Platform: 10600KF

### Frustum Culling

</div>

> *Bevy 0.11.3, crate 0.1.1, 1000x1000 tiles*

### Pathfinding

The pathfinding algorithm is very fast.

Notice this tests are done with **synchronized pathfinding**. Which means whole algorithm will figure the path out in one frame. But since `0.2.1`, the asynchronized one in implemented. So the algorithm can complete a part of the pathfinding and continue it in the next frame. This will make it even smoother.

| Size      | Time(avg of 3 tests) ms |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| 100x100   | 12.00                   |
| 500x500   | 295.67                  |
| 1000x1000 | 1384.33                 |

> *Bevy 0.12, crate 0.2.1, using `pathfinding` example*

### Wave Function Collapse

In the following case, each tile has at least one corresponding color gap with its neighboring tiles.

## Special Thanks

- SSAO & Volumetric Clouds / Fog inspired by [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KG411U7uk/).
- [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap). I took this crate as the reference and learnt the basis of bevy rendering.
