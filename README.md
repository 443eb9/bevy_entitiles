# Bevy EntiTiles

A tilemap library for bevy.

**Notice** that the crate is still in need of optimization. So don't use this in your formal projects.

Highly recommend to checkout [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`]([StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap: A tilemap rendering crate for bevy which is more ECS friendly. (github.com)](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap)) . It's more complete.
