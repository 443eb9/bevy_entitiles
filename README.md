# Bevy EntiTiles üó∫Ô∏è

A 2d tilemap library for bevy. With many useful algorithms/tools built in.

This repo is under maintenance as long as this message exists. ( Hope this message can bring you peace of mind. Yeah, that's childish :p )

It's **NOT** recommended to use the code in `dev` branch! There's full of incomplete code and even errors! But `master` branch would be ok if you can't wait to try out new features.

## Future Goals

*The higher the priority, the more towards the front in the following list.*

- Chunk Unloading
- Optimization
- Tilemap Serializing (Physics)
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) Support
- Custom Material
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
- SSAO
- Realtime Lighting
- Runtime Mesh & Texture Baking
- Wang Tiling
- Tilemap Mask
- ~~Frustum Culling~~
- ~~Pathfinding~~
- ~~Physics~~
- ~~[LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) Full Support~~
- ~~Infinite Tilemap~~

## Known Issues

- Spawning another tilemap while the program is running will cause panic.

## Coordinate Systems

The x and y axes in the tilemaps are the index axes. And those x and y on a single tile means the actual mesh size. Which you can control using `tile_render_size`.

*`legs` here are mathematically incorrect, please consider it as a new concept.*

## Show Cases & Performance

Platform: 10600KF

**Notice: Due to the performance overhead caused by the recorder, the fps value maybe inaccurate!**

### LDtk

The gif on the right is the map generated with wave function collapse. And the orange boxes in the left image is procedural generated colliders.

### Chunk Unloading

I know you are confused about these weird boxes, so please check the [`chunk_unloading`]([examples/chunk_unloading.rs](https://github.com/443eb9/bevy_entitiles/blob/master/examples/chunk_unloading.rs)) example if you want to get further info.

### Pathfinding

The pathfinding algorithm is very fast.

Notice this tests are done with **synchronized pathfinding**. Which means whole algorithm will figure the path out in one frame. But since `0.2.1`, the asynchronized one in implemented. So the algorithm can complete a part of the pathfinding and continue it in the next frame. This will make it even smoother.

| Size      | Time(avg of 3 tests) ms |

| 500x500   | 295.67                  |
| 1000x1000 | 1384.33                 |

> *Bevy 0.12.0, crate 0.2.1, using `pathfinding` example*

### Wave Function Collapse

The wave function collapse algorithm is also fast. XD

In the following case, each tile has at least one corresponding color gap with its neighboring tiles.

**Notice: The funtionality of visualizing the process of wfc was removed in 0.2.6**

## Limitations

- Supports up to 4 rendered layers* in one tilemap.
- Supports up to 64 animations in one tilemap. (this will no longer exists in the future)
- Supports up to 16 length of animation sequences.

*\* Rendered layer means the layer that will be **rendered**. You can insert as much layers as you want, but only the 4 top layers will be rendered.*

- SSAO & Volumetric Clouds / Fog inspired by [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KG411U7uk/).
- [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap) I took this crate as the reference and learnt the basis of bevy rendering!
- [`bevy_ecs_ldtk`](https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk) I was confused and have no idea about how to instantiate LDtk entities before I read this crate! I also learnt proc macros and many other things from this crate!
