# âœ¨Bevy EntiTiles ðŸŽˆ

A tilemap library for bevy. With many algorithms built in.

**Notice** that the crate is still in need of optimization and development. So don't use this in your formal projects.

Strongly recommend that you take a look at the [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap) library first, as it is more comprehensive and mature.

**I will maintain this repo as long as this message exists**
