# âœ¨Bevy EntiTiles ðŸŽˆ

A tilemap library for bevy. With many algorithms built in.

This crate is still in need of **optimization and development**. ~~So don't use this in your formal projects.~~ But I think it's already capable to be a part of your project.

Strongly recommend that you take a look at the [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap) library first, as it is more comprehensive and mature.

This repo is under maintenance as long as this message exists. ( Hope this message can bring you peace of mind. )

Notice that the following progress may be not up to date. Check the `README.md` in `dev` brach to get the newest progress!

## Currently Working On

- Wave Function Collapse

## Future Goals

- Wave Function Collapse ( Release & Optimization )
- Pathfinding ( Optimization )
- Tilemap-Link
- Runtime Mesh & Texture Baking
- Tilemap Serializing
- SSAO
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
- Wang Tilling
- Tilemap Mask
- Frustum Culling ( Isometric Specific Optimization )

## Show Case

Platform: 10600KF With 1000*1000 tiles
