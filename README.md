# Bevy EntiTiles üó∫Ô∏è

A 2d tilemap library for bevy. With many useful algorithms/tools built in.

Try to be the most **comprehensive**, **performant**, and **up-to-date** 2d tilemap crate for bevy.

This repo is under maintenance as long as this message exists!!

It's **NOT** recommended to use the code in `dev` branch! There's full of incomplete code and even errors! But `master` branch would be ok if you can't wait to try out new features.

This crate is largely inspired from [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap)(Rendering) and [`bevy_ecs_ldtk`](https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk)(LDtk entity spawning)

## Future Goals

*The higher the priority, the more towards the front in the following list.*

- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) Support
- Runtime Mesh & Texture Baking
- Custom Material
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
- SSAO
- Realtime Lighting
- Wang Tiling
- Tilemap Mask
- ~~Frustum Culling~~
- ~~Pathfinding~~
- ~~Physics~~
- ~~[LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) Support~~
- ~~Infinite Tilemap~~
- ~~Chunk Unloading~~
- ~~Tilemap Serializing~~

## Feature Flags

| Flag          | Funtionality                                                                            |

| `algorithm`   | Implementation of algorithms                                                            |
| `atlas`       | Use calculated uv coordinates on a entire texture instead of using texture arrays.      |
| `debug`       | Show some debug info including aabbs for chunks and tilemaps, path finding results etc. |
| `ldtk`        | [LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) support.                                                       |
| `physics`     | Physics support using [`bevy_xpbd`](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd).              |
| `serializing` | Save and load the tilemap from files. Also contains tools for upgrading files.          |
| `tiled`       | [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) support.                                            |

## Coordinate Systems

The x and y axes in the tilemaps are the index axes. And those x and y on a single tile means the actual mesh size. Which you can control using `tile_render_size`.

*`legs` here are mathematically incorrect, please consider it as a new concept.*

## Show Cases & Performance

Platform: 10600KF

**Notice: Due to the performance overhead caused by the recorder, the fps value maybe inaccurate!**

### LDtk

The gif on the right is the map generated with wave function collapse. And the orange boxes in the left image is procedural generated colliders.

### Chunk Unloading

I know you are confused about these weird boxes, so please check the [`chunk_unloading`](https://github.com/443eb9/bevy_entitiles/blob/master/examples/chunk_unloading.rs) example if you want to get further info.

> *Bevy 0.12.1, crate 0.2.7*

### Pathfinding

Notice this tests are done with **synchronized pathfinding**. Which means whole algorithm will figure the path out in one frame. But since `0.2.1`, the asynchronized one in implemented. So the algorithm can complete a part of the pathfinding and continue it in the next frame. This will make it even smoother.

**Notice: The synchronized pathfinding was removed in 0.3.0.**

### Wave Function Collapse

In the following case, each tile has at least one corresponding color gap with its neighboring tiles.

**Notice: The funtionality of visualizing the process of wfc was removed in 0.2.6**

## Limitations

- Supports up to 4 rendered layers* in one tilemap.

*\* Rendered layer means the layer that will be **rendered**. You can insert as much layers as you want, but only the 4 top layers will be rendered.*

## Versions

*LDtk version is the version that json api has changed. So you can also use 1.5.2 in 0.2.7.</br>See [this](https://ldtk.io/json/next/#changes) for more information.*
