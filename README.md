# Bevy EntiTiles üó∫Ô∏è

A 2d tilemap library for bevy. With many useful algorithms/tools built in.

*Warning: Before using this crate, be prepared for potentially AnNoYiNg API changes that come with almost each version update.*

This repo is under maintenance as long as this message exists. ( Hope this message can bring you peace of mind. Yeah, that's childish :p )

It's **NOT** recommended to use the code in `dev` branch! There's full of incomplete code and even errors! But `master` branch would be ok if you can't wait to try out new features.

## Future Goals

*The higher the priority, the more towards the front in the following list.*

- Pathfinding (for LDtk maps)
- Wave Function Collapse ( Collapse map from LDtk; Optimization )
- Chunk Unloading
- Infinite Tilemap
- Runtime Mesh & Texture Baking
- Wang Tilling
- Tilemap Mask
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) Support
- Volumetric Clouds / Fog
- SSAO
- Lighting
- Realtime Shadow
- ~~Frustum Culling~~
- ~~Physics~~
- ~~[LDtk](https://ldtk.io/) Full Support~~

## Known Issues

- The success probability of the wfc algorithm significantly decreased after switching to `LookupHeap`. ( And that's why I didn't switch to `LookupHeap` )
- Spawning another tilemap while the program is running will cause panic.

| `physics_xpbd`   | Physics support for [`bevy_xpbd`](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd), like setting colliders etc. |
| `serializing`    | Save and load the tilemap from files. Also contains tools for upgrading files.                       |
| `ui`             | Support renderring tiles as ui image.                                                                |

## Coordinate Systems

The x and y axes in the tilemaps are the index axes. And those x and y on a single tile means the actual mesh size. Which you can control using `tile_render_size`.

*`legs` here are mathematically incorrect, please consider it as a new concept.*

### Frustum Culling

### Pathfinding

The pathfinding algorithm is very fast.

Notice this tests are done with **synchronized pathfinding**. Which means whole algorithm will figure the path out in one frame. But since `0.2.1`, the asynchronized one in implemented. So the algorithm can complete a part of the pathfinding and continue it in the next frame. This will make it even smoother.

| Size      | Time(avg of 3 tests) ms |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| 100x100   | 12.00                   |
| 500x500   | 295.67                  |
| 1000x1000 | 1384.33                 |

> *Bevy 0.12, crate 0.2.1, using `pathfinding` example*

### Wave Function Collapse

In the following case, each tile has at least one corresponding color gap with its neighboring tiles.

| 100x100 | (Not measurable)        | 32,309.045 (16)         |

## Limitations

- Supports up to 4 rendered layers* in one tilemap.
- Supports up to 64 animations in one tilemap. (this will no longer exists in the future)
- Supports up to 16 length of animation sequences.

*\* Rendered layer means the layer that will be **rendered**. You can insert as much layers as you want, but only the 4 top layers will be rendered.*

- SSAO & Volumetric Clouds / Fog inspired by [this video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1KG411U7uk/).
- [`bevy_ecs_tilemap`](https://github.com/StarArawn/bevy_ecs_tilemap) I took this crate as the reference and learnt the basis of bevy rendering!
- [`bevy_ecs_ldtk`](https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk) I was confused and have no idea about how to instantiate LDtk entities before I read this crate! I also learnt proc macros and many other things from this crate!
